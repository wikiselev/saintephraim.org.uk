    <h3 class="alert-heading">Service Booking</h3>
    <p>
        Due to UK government restrictions to counter the Covid-19, pandemic,  we are currently holding services with a reduced number attending.
        <br><br>
        Many of our people wish to come to the Divine Liturgy every Sunday. The current UK government restrictions, however, make this impossible. Taking into account the number of our parishioners, everyone will be able to attend the Divine Liturgy once every two weeks, provided the following instructions are followed and everyone books accordingly. You are always welcome to make a booking to attend Great Vespers on Saturday. Please be mindful of the restriction, when making a booking.
        <br><br>
        There has also been a change to our booking system.  You and each member of your family now needs to make a separate booking. Once a booking is made each person you will receive a confirmatory e-mail which must be shown to the Steward, either on your mobile phone or in hard copy,  before you can be admitted to the service. The booking system manager will ensure that the total number of bookings for a service does not exceed the limit. Therefore, if you happen to overbook, your extra booking (e.g. a second Divine Liturgy in consecutive weeks) will be cancelled and you will be notified of this via e-mail. If your booking is cancelled, you will not be admitted to attend that specific service.
        <br><br>
        Please also read the following documents:
        <ul>
            <li><a href="docs/flower-01.pdf" class="alert-link">Instructions for set-up and flower arranging.</a></li>
            <li><a href="docs/people-08.pdf" class="alert-link">Instructions for the people.</a></li>
            <li><a href="docs/altar-04.pdf" class="alert-link">Instructions for the Altar.</a></li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        If you wish to submit a prayer request with a list of names to be remembered in the Divine Liturgy, please send an e-mail with no more than 20 names (Orthodox living + departed) and the Divine Liturgy date you wish the names to be remembered on to the following e-mail address: <a href="mailto:prayer.requests@saintephraim.org.uk" class="alert-link" target="_blank">prayer.requests@saintephraim.org.uk</a>

    <h3 class="alert-heading">SERVICES DURING LOCKDOWN</h3>
    <p>
        The Government have announced a second lockdown from 5 November until 2 December, 2020.
        <br><br>
        During that time we shall stream our services, via Zoom. Services will be streamed from St Clement’s, at the times shown on the website, but behind closed doors. Only a minimum of people - priest, servers, reader, singers - will be allowed under government regulations to be in the church during the service.
        <br><br>
        There will be separate Zoom links for Great Vespers and for the Divine Liturgy. These links are as follows:
        <br><br>

        I must emphasise that government regulation require the services to be celebrated behind closed doors and that only those taking part in the service can be admitted to the church. Please, therefore, do not come to the services unless you are asked to do.
