The spiritual leader of our parish is Father Raphael, who is the last priest to be ordained by the Archbishop Antony of Sourozh. Fr Raphael, who hails from Bedfordshire, and his American-born wife Carolyn are themselves converts to Orthodoxy. ‘Carolyn and I were received into the Orthodox Church in New York, almost 30 years ago, when I was working in Manhattan.’ he explains while declining to be drawn as to why British people might find Orthodoxy an attractive proposition.
