During his visit Metropolitan Anthony also served the Divine Liturgy, for the small number of Russian Orthodox Christians living here which as far as we know, was the first occasion on which the Liturgy was served in Cambridge and we regard Vladyka Anthony\'s visit as the founding event in the life of our parish. A priest was sent from London to celebrate the Liturgy every month. By June 1978, Metropolitan Anthony gave the Community its own antimension. The community was placed in the care of Archpriest Basil Osborne who came to Cambridge from Oxford one Saturday each month, for over 20 years, to serve the Liturgy and care for the people. <br><br> Fr John Jillions became the priest of the parish in 1998. We had no permanent home until, in December 2000, the community began to worship in the Chapel of Westcott House, an Anglican Theological College. This arrangement was intended to last until the end of 2001, but we worshipped there for another 17 years before moving to St Clement\'s Church on Bridge Street! Fr Raphael Armour was ordained to serve as a second priest to the Community in July 2001. In 2002, the community was received as a Parish of the Sourozh Diocese. Fr Raphael succeed Fr John as Rector of the Parish the following year. </p> <br> </div> <div class="col-md-6 col-sm-6 col-xs-12"> <!-- <div class="row">\n			<div class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1 col-xs-10 col-xs-offset-1">\n				<div class="embed-responsive embed-responsive-4by3">\n					<iframe class="embed-responsive-item" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/videoseries?list=PLNRTQPmTft_EyCih27tuXhDDrA0PeXxF5" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>\n				</div>\n			</div>\n		</div> --> <br> <div class="row"> <div class="col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"> <script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/publicalbum@latest/embed-ui.min.js" async></script> <div class="pa-gallery-player-widget" style="width:100%;

As a teacher, St Ephraim took up the responsibility of passing on the Orthodox faith in a society where pagan religions, Judaism and early Christian sects vied with one another for adherents.

Our parishioners come from Russia, Romania, Bulgaria, Serbia, Greece, Bulgaria and Cyprus with others, mainly converts, from the UK, Germany, Switzerland, Zimbabwe, Australia, Hong Kong, South Africa and the USA. Each year several University students become part of the parish during their studies in Cambridge. From the 30 people who worshipped at the Divine Liturgy in 2001, on most Sundays we now have some 120 people, about 20% being under the age of eight! </p> <h3>Join Us</h3> <p> If you are just a visitor, you are welcome to explore the website and to learn more about the Parish.
